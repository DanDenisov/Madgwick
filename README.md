# Madgwick
Implementation of the Madgwick's filter on an Android platform.

**The Madgwick filter** is used for control of orientation of an IMU system (accelerometer + gyroscope) or a MARG system 
(accelerometer + gyroscope + magnetometer). Originally, a concept of this filter was presented by Sebastian Madgwick in his 
[technical report](https://x-io.co.uk/res/doc/madgwick_internal_report.pdf).

This project demonstrates how to effectively use this filter 
to obtain the orientation of an Android smartphone.

*Note: this project was made as a university task long ago and contains a dirty code (perhaps with some bugs as well). 
If you're about to use it, be careful.*
